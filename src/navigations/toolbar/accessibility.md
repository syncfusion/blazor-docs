# Accessibility

The Toolbar component has been designed,  keeping in mind the [WAI-ARIA](http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-practices/) specifications, and applying the WAI-ARIA roles, states and properties along with keyboard support for people who use assistive devices. WAI-ARIA accessibility support is achieved through attributes like `aria-orientation`, `aria-disabled` and `aria-haspopup`. It provides
  information about elements in a document for assistive technology.  The component implements keyboard navigation support by following the [WAI-ARIA practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/), and has been tested in major screen readers.

## ARIA attributes

The Toolbar element is assigned the role of `toolbar`.

| **Property** | **Functionalities** |
| --- | --- |
| role="toolbar" | This attribute added to the ToolBar element describes the actual role of the element. |
| aria-orientation     | Indicates the ToolBar orientation. Default value is `horizontal`. |
| aria-haspopup       | Indicates the popup mode of the Toolbar. Default value is false. When popup mode is enabled,  attribute value has to be changed to `true`. | |
| aria-disabled       | Indicates the disabled state of the ToolBar. |
