# Accessibility

Accessibility is achieved in the Tree Grid component through WAI-ARIA standard and keyboard navigations.  The Tree Grid features can be effectively accessed through assistive technologies such as screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA

WAI-ARIA (Accessibility Initiative â€“ Accessible Rich Internet Applications) defines a way to increase the accessibility of web pages, dynamic content, and user interface components developed with Ajax, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies. ARIA provides additional semantics to describe the role, state, and functionality of web components.

The following ARIA attributes are used in the Tree Grid:
* grid (role)
* row (role)
* gridcell (role)
* aria-selected (attribute)
* aria-expanded (attribute)
* aria-sort (attribute)
* aria-busy (attribute)
* aria-invalid (attribute)
* aria-grabbed (attribute)
* aria-owns (attribute)
* aria-label (attribute)

## Keyboard navigation

Tree Grid functionalities can be interactive with keyboard shortcuts.

The following keyboard shortcuts are supported by Tree Grid.
