# Deployment

This section provides information about deploying applications with the Syncfusion Blazor components.

You can get more information about deploying Blazor applications [Here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/blazor/).

## Publish Blazor Application with Visual Studio 2019

* Create the Blazor server Application with [Syncfusion Blazor Components](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/server-side-blazor/).

> **Note:** You have to change the base path of the application. Refer to the [MSDN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/blazor/?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio#app-base-path) for more details.

* Right-click on the project in the `Solution Explorer` and select `Publish`.

* Then, select the `Folder` option and select the publishing target location.

* Check the configuration as Release by clicking the `Advanced...` option below the target location.

>Note: For `Blazor Server Application`, Deployment Mode is set to
`Self-Contained`.

Because some dependencies are not loaded properly when we host the published folder.

* Then, click `Save` and `Publish`.

> Refer [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/deployment/quickstart-deploy-to-azure?view=vs-2019) for publishing the application to Azure App Service using Visual Studio.  

## Publish Blazor Application with CLI

Packing the application and its dependencies into a folder for deployment to a hosting system by using the `dotnet publish` command.

For CLI deployment, run the following command from your root directory.

```bash
    dotnet publish -c Release
````

For Blazor Server CLI deployment.

```bash
    dotnet publish -c Release --self-contained true -r win-x86
````

Refer to the dotnet publish\'s [optional arguments](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish?tabs=netcore21#arguments).

### Output location

Use the following command to specify the path for the output directory.

```bash
    dotnet publish -c Release -o <output directory>
```

> If the output directory not specified, it defaults to `./bin/[configuration]/[framework]/publish/` for a **framework-dependent deployment** or `./bin/[configuration]/[framework]/[runtime]/publish/` for a **self-contained deployment**.

If the path is relative, the output directory generated is relative to the project file location, not to the current working directory.

Also, refer to the MSDN reference [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/azure-apps/?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=netcore-cli#deploy-the-app-self-contained).

Now, you can host the published folder by using the IIS or Azure app service.
