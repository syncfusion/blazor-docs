# Node Editing

The TreeView allows you to edit nodes by setting the `AllowEditing` property to **true**.
To directly edit the nodes in place, **double click** the TreeView node or **select** the node and press **F2** key.

When editing is completed by focus out or by pressing the **Enter** key, the modified node’s text saves automatically. If you do not want to save the modified node’s text in TreeView node, press **Escape** key. It does not save the edited text to the TreeView node.

* Node editing can also be performed programmatically by using the `BeginEdit` method. On passing the node ID or element through this method, the edit textbox will be created for the particular node thus allowing us to edit it.

* If you need to validate or prevent editing, the `NodeEditing` event can be used which is triggered before the TreeView node is renamed. On successfully renaming a node the `NodeEdited` event will be triggered.

```csharp
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Navigations
<SfTreeView TValue="DriveData" AllowEditing="true">
    <TreeViewFieldsSettings TValue="DriveData" Id="NodeId" Text="NodeText" Child="Children" DataSource="@Drive" Expanded="Expanded"></TreeViewFieldsSettings>
</SfTreeView>

        });

        List<DriveData> File4 = new List<DriveData>();

        Folder2.Add(new DriveData
        {
            NodeId = "02-01",
            NodeText = "Personals"
