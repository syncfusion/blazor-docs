# Getting Started in Blazor Card

This section briefly explains about how to include a `Card` in your Blazor server-side application. You can refer [Getting Started with Syncfusion Blazor for Server-Side in Visual Studio 2019](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/blazor-webassembly-visual-studio-2019/) page for the introduction and configuring the common specifications.

## Importing Syncfusion Blazor component in the application

You can use any one of the below standards to install the Syncfusion Blazor library in your application.

### Using Syncfusion Blazor individual NuGet Packages [New standard]

> Starting with Volume 4, 2020 (v18.4.0.30) release, Syncfusion provides [individual NuGet packages](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/nuget-packages/) for our Syncfusion Blazor components. We highly recommend this new standard for your Blazor production applications. Refer to [this section](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/nuget-packages/#benefits-of-using-individual-nuget-packages) to know the benefits of the individual NuGet packages.

1. Install **Syncfusion.Blazor.Cards** NuGet package to the application by using the `NuGet Package Manager`.

2. You can add the client-side style resources from NuGet package in the `<head>` element of the **~/Pages/_Host.cshtml** page.

```html
    <head>
        ....
        ....
        <link href="_content/Syncfusion.Blazor.Themes/bootstrap4.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    </head>
```

> Warning: `Syncfusion.Blazor` package should not be installed along with [individual NuGet packages](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/nuget-packages/). Hence, you have to add the above `Syncfusion.Blazor.Themes` static web assets (styles) in the application.

### Using Syncfusion.Blazor NuGet Package [Old standard]

> Warning: If you prefer the above new standard (individual NuGet packages), then skip this section. Using both old and new standards in the same application will throw ambiguous compilation errors.

1. Install **Syncfusion.Blazor** NuGet package to the newly created application by using the `NuGet Package Manager`.

2. You can add the client-side style resources through CDN or from NuGet package in the `<head>` element of the **~/Pages/_Host.cshtml** page.

```html
    <head>
        <link href="_content/Syncfusion.Blazor/styles/bootstrap4.css" rel="stylesheet" />
         @*<link href="https://cdn.syncfusion.com/blazor/{:version:}/styles/bootstrap4.css" rel="stylesheet" />*@
    </head>
```

> For Internet Explorer 11 kindly refer the polyfills. Refer the [documentation](../../common/how-to/render-blazor-server-app-in-ie/) for more information.

```html

<head>
    <link href="_content/Syncfusion.Blazor/styles/bootstrap4.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    <script src="https://github.com/Daddoon/Blazor.Polyfill/releases/download/3.0.1/blazor.polyfill.min.js"></script>
</head>

```

## Adding component package to the application

Open `**~/_Imports.razor` file and import the `Syncfusion.Blazor.**`

```csharp
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Cards
```

## Add SyncfusionBlazor service in Startup.cs

Open the **Startup.cs** file and add services required by Syncfusion components using **service.AddSyncfusionBlazor()** method. Add this method in the **ConfigureServices** function as follows.

```csharp
using Syncfusion.Blazor;
namespace BlazorApplication
{
    public class Startup
    {
        ....
        ....
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            ....
            ....
            services.AddSyncfusionBlazor();
        }
    }
}
```

**Note:** To enable custom client side resource loading from CRG or CDN. You need to disable resource loading by `AddSyncfusionBlazor(true)` and load the scripts in the **HEAD** element of the **~/Pages/_Host.cshtml** page.

```csharp
<head>
    <script src="https://cdn.syncfusion.com/blazor/18.1.36-beta/dist/syncfusion-blazor.min.js"></script>
</head>
```

## Adding Card component to the application

Now, add the Syncfusion Blazor components in any web page (razor) in the Pages folder. For example, the Card component is added in the **~/Pages/Index.razor** page.

```csharp
<SfCard> Sample Card </SfCard>
```

## Adding a header and content

1. You can create Card with a header in a specific structure. For adding header you can use `CardHeader` tag and in that `Title` and `SubTitle` can be given.

2. Also content will be added by using `CardContent` tag.

```csharp
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Cards

<div class="control-section">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-lg-6 col-md-6">
            <SfCard>
                <CardHeader Title="Debunking Five Data Science Myths" SubTitle="By John Doe | Jan 20, 2018" />
                <CardContent Content="Tech evangelists are currently pounding their pulpits about all things AI, machine learning, analyticsâ€”anything that sounds like the future and probably involves lots of numbers. Many of these topics can be grouped under the intimidating term data science." />
            </SfCard>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

## Run the application

After successful compilation of your application, the Syncfusion Blazor Card component will render in the web browser.
