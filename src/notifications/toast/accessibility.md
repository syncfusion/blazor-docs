# Accessibility

The toast component has been designed with [WAI-ARIA](http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-practices/) specifications in mind by applying the prompt WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties with the keyboard support. It helps users who use assistive WAI-ARIA accessibility support, which is achieved using attributes.

It provides information about the elements in a document for assistive technology.

The toast component implements the keyboard navigation support by using the following [WAI-ARIA practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/) and is tested in major screen readers.
