# ASP.NET MVC Scaffolding

Syncfusion includes an extension for **Visual Studio Scaffolding** for the Syncfusion ASP.NET MVC platform to quickly add code that interacts with data models and reduce the amount of time to develop with data operation in your project. Scaffolding provides an easier way to create Views and Controller action methods for Syncfusion ASP.NET MVC  Chart controls.

> Note: The Syncfusion ASP.NET MVC UI Scaffolder is available from **v16.4.0.40**.

## Getting Started

Let's start with the steps on how to scaffold the ASP.NET MVC Chart into your web application.

* Create an ASP.NET MVC application and add an Entity Framework data model referring from the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/getting-started/database-first-development/creating-the-web-application#generate-the-models) with Scheduler related fields such as Id, Subject, Location, Start Date, End Date and All-day. Once the model file is added, ensure the required DBContext and all its related properties are added.

* Refer the [Getting Started documentation](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/aspnetmvc/documentation/getting-started/visual-studio-2017/#configure-essential-js-2-in-the-application) to know about how to configure the Syncfusion Essential JS2 for ASP.NET MVC in your web application.

## Add a Scaffolded Item

The following steps direct you to add a Scaffolded item to your ASP.NET MVC Web Application.

* Right-click on Controller folder in the Solution Explorer and select **Add → New Scaffolded Item.**

> Note: Ensure that  at least one Entity Framework model  exists in your project and the application gets compiled once. If no Entity Framework model exists in your application, refer to the [`documentation`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/getting-started/database-first-development/creating-the-web-application#generate-the-models) to generate the Entity Framework model. Once model file added, ensure required DBContext and properties are added. Now, build the application and try scaffolding. If any changes done in model properties later, compile the application once before perform scaffolding.
