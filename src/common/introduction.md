## How to best read this user guide

* The best way to get started would be to read the "Getting Started" section of the
documentation for the component that you would like to start using first. The `Getting Started` gives just enough information that you need to know before starting to write code.
This is the only section that we recommend reading end-to-end before starting to write code,
all other information can be referred to as needed.

* Now that you are familiar with the basics of using the component, the next step would
be to start integrating the component into your application. A good starting point
would be to refer to the code snippets in the [online sample browser](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/demos/)
which contains hundreds of code samples, you will likely find
a code sample that resembles your intended usage scenario.
