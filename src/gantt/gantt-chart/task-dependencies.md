# Task Dependencies

Task dependency or task relationship can be established between two tasks in Gantt Chart. This dependency affects the project schedule. If you change the predecessor of a task, it will affect the successor task, which will affect the next task, and so on.

## Task relationship types

Task relationships are categorized into four types based on the start and finish dates of the task.

### Start to Start (SS)

You cannot start a task until the dependent task also starts.

### Start to Finish (SF)

You cannot finish a task until the dependent task is started.

### Finish to Start (FS)

You cannot start a task until the dependent task is completed.

### Finish to Finish (FF)

You cannot finish a task until the dependent task is completed.

## Define task relationship

Task relationship is defined in the data source as a string value, and this value is mapped to the Gantt Chart component by using the `TaskFields.Dependency` property. The following code example demonstrates how to enable the predecessor in the Gantt Chart component.

```csharp
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Gantt
<SfGantt DataSource="@TaskCollection" Height="450px" Width="700px">
    <GanttTaskFields Id="TaskId" Name="TaskName" StartDate="StartDate" EndDate="EndDate" Duration="Duration" Progress="Progress" Child="SubTasks" Dependency="Predecessor">
    </GanttTaskFields>
</SfGantt>

@code{
    public List<TaskData> TaskCollection { get; set; }
    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        this.TaskCollection = GetTaskCollection();
    }

    public class TaskData
    {
        public int TaskId { get; set; }
        public string TaskName { get; set; }
        public DateTime StartDate { get; set; }
        public DateTime EndDate { get; set; }
        public string Duration { get; set; }
        public int Progress { get; set; }
        public string Predecessor { get; set; }
        public List<TaskData> SubTasks { get; set; }
    }

    public static List <TaskData> GetTaskCollection() {
    List <TaskData> Tasks = new List <TaskData> () {
        new TaskData() {
            TaskId = 1,
            TaskName = "Project initiation",
            StartDate = new DateTime(2019, 04, 02),
            EndDate = new DateTime(2019, 04, 21),
            SubTasks = (new List <TaskData> () {
                new TaskData() {
                    TaskId = 2,
                    TaskName = "Identify Site location",
                    StartDate = new DateTime(2019, 04, 02),
                    Duration = "0",
                    Progress = 30,
                },
                new TaskData() {
                    TaskId = 3,
                    TaskName = "Perform soil test",
                    StartDate = new DateTime(2019, 04, 02),
                    Duration = "4",
                    Progress = 40,
                    Predecessor = "2"
                },
                new TaskData() {
                    TaskId = 4,
                    TaskName = "Soil test approval",
                    StartDate = new DateTime(2019, 04, 02),
                    Duration = "0",
                    Progress = 30,
                    Predecessor = "3"
                },
            })
        },
        new TaskData() {
            TaskId = 5,
            TaskName = "Project estimation",
            StartDate = new DateTime(2019, 04, 02),
            EndDate = new DateTime(2019, 04, 21),
            SubTasks = (new List <TaskData> () {
                new TaskData() {
                    TaskId = 6,
                    TaskName = "Develop floor plan for estimation",
                    StartDate = new DateTime(2019, 04, 04),
                    Duration = "3",
                    Progress = 30,
                    Predecessor = "4"
                },
                new TaskData() {
                    TaskId = 7,
                    TaskName = "List materials",
                    StartDate = new DateTime(2019, 04, 04),
                    Duration = "3",
                    Progress = 40,
                    Predecessor = "6"
                },
                new TaskData() {
                    TaskId = 8,
                    TaskName = "Estimation approval",
                    StartDate = new DateTime(2019, 04, 04),
                    Duration = "0",
                    Progress = 30,
                    Predecessor = "7"
                },
            })
        }
    };

    return Tasks;
}
}
```

The following screenshot displays the output of the above code.

## Predecessor offset with duration units

In the Gantt Chart component, the predecessor offset can be defined with the following duration units:

* Day
* Hour
* Minute

You can define an offset with various offset duration units for predecessors by using the following code example.

```csharp
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Gantt
<SfGantt DataSource="@TaskCollection" Height="450px" Width="900px">
    <GanttTaskFields Id="TaskId" Name="TaskName" StartDate="StartDate" EndDate="EndDate" Duration="Duration" Progress="Progress" Dependency="Predecessor" Child="SubTasks">
    </GanttTaskFields>
</SfGantt>
@code{
    public List<TaskData> TaskCollection { get; set; }
    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        this.TaskCollection = GetTaskCollection();
    }

    public class TaskData
    {
        public int TaskId { get; set; }
        public string TaskName { get; set; }
        public DateTime StartDate { get; set; }
        public DateTime EndDate { get; set; }
        public string Duration { get; set; }
        public int Progress { get; set; }
        public string Predecessor { get; set; }
        public List<TaskData> SubTasks { get; set; }
    }

    public static List <TaskData> GetTaskCollection() {
    List <TaskData> Tasks = new List <TaskData> () {
        new TaskData() {
            TaskId = 1,
            TaskName = "Project initiation",
            StartDate = new DateTime(2019, 04, 02),
            EndDate = new DateTime(2019, 04, 21),
            SubTasks = (new List <TaskData> () {
                new TaskData() {
                    TaskId = 2,
                    TaskName = "Identify Site location",
                    StartDate = new DateTime(2019, 04, 02),
                    Duration = "0",
                    Progress = 30,
                },
                new TaskData() {
                    TaskId = 3,
                    TaskName = "Perform soil test",
                    StartDate = new DateTime(2019, 04, 02),
                    Duration = "4",
                    Progress = 40,
                    Predecessor = "2FS+2d"
                },
                new TaskData() {
                    TaskId = 4,
                    TaskName = "Soil test approval",
                    StartDate = new DateTime(2019, 04, 02),
                    Duration = "0",
                    Progress = 30,
                    Predecessor = "3FF+960m"
                },
            })
        },
        new TaskData() {
            TaskId = 5,
            TaskName = "Project estimation",
            StartDate = new DateTime(2019, 04, 02),
            EndDate = new DateTime(2019, 04, 21),
            SubTasks = (new List <TaskData> () {
                new TaskData() {
                    TaskId = 6,
                    TaskName = "Develop floor plan for estimation",
                    StartDate = new DateTime(2019, 04, 04),
                    Duration = "3",
                    Progress = 30,
                },
                new TaskData() {
                    TaskId = 7,
                    TaskName = "List materials",
                    StartDate = new DateTime(2019, 04, 04),
                    Duration = "3",
                    Progress = 40,
                    Predecessor = "6SS+16h"
                },
            })
        }
    };

    return Tasks;
}
}
```
