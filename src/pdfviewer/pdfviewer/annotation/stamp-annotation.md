Refer to the following code snippet to set the default sticky note annotation settings.

```csharp
@using Syncfusion.Blazor

@code{
    SfPdfViewerServer viewer;
    private string DocumentPath { get; set; } = "wwwroot/Data/PDF_Succinctly.pdf";
    PdfViewerStampSettings StampSettings = new PdfViewerStampSettings {Opacity=0.3,Author="Blazor" };

}
```
