# Create collapsible Tabs

You can achieve collapse and expand functionality in Tab by adding/removing a custom CSS class in the click event handler for each tab.

* Define a CSS class to set the style property display as none. Here 'collapse' class is added to the content element for hiding it.
* Bind the `select`  event for Tab to collapse the initially selected Tab item and bind custom click handler for the Tab headers.
* In the event handler, add and remove 'collapse' class to hide and show the corresponding Tab content.
