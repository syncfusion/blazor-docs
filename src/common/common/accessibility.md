# Accessibility

All the Syncfusion Blazor components follow the WAI-ARIA accessibility standard by default. This enables you to build accessible web applications, which are fully navigable by users with disabilities.

## Keyboard navigation

Keyboard navigation support enables users to interact with components using keyboard shortcuts. Each component has its own set of shortcuts. Refer to the following documents to get the details of each component.
