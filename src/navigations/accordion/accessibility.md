# Accessibility

The Accordion component has been designed keeping in mind the [WAI-ARIA](http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-practices/) specifications, by applying the prompt WAI-ARIA roles, states and properties along with the keyboard support. Thus, making it usable for people who use assistive WAI-ARIA Accessibility supports that is achieved through the attributes like `aria-multiselectable`, `aria-disabled`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-selected` and `aria-hidden`.
It helps to provides information about the elements in a document for assistive technology.
The component implements the keyboard navigation support by following the
  [WAI-ARIA practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/) and tested in major screen readers.
