# Globalization

* Globalization is the combination of adapting the control to various languages by parsing and formatting the date or numbers (`Internationalization (L18N)`) and adding cultural-specific customizations and translating the text (`Localization (L10N)`).

* The Syncfusion Blazor UI components are specific to the `American English (en-US)` culture by default. It utilizes the `Blazor Internationalization` package to parse and format the number and date objects based on the chosen culture.

* Suppose, if you want to change any specific culture, then add the corresponding culture resource (`.resx`) file by using the below reference.
