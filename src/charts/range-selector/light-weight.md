# Lightweight range navigator

By default, when the DataSource for series property in RangeNavigator is empty, a light weight Range navigator will get initialized without chart. The following code example shows the basic lightweight range navigator.

{% aspTab template="range-navigator/light-weight", sourceFiles="light-weight.razor" %}

{% endaspTab %}
