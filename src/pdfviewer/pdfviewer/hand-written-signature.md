# Handwritten Signature

The PDF Viewer control supports adding handwritten signatures to a PDF document. The handwritten signature reduces the paper work of reviewing the content and verifies it digitally.

The handwritten signature can be added to the PDF document using the annotation toolbar.

* Click the **Edit Annotation** button in the PDF Viewer toolbar. A toolbar appears below it.
* Select the **HandWritten Signature** button in the annotation toolbar. The signature panel will appear.
