# Accessibility

The MultiSelect component has been designed, keeping in mind the `WAI-ARIA` specifications, and applies
the WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties along with `keyboard support`. This component is characterized
by complete keyboard interaction support and ARIA accessibility support that makes it easy for people who
use assistive technologies (AT) or those who completely rely on keyboard navigation.

## ARIA attributes

The MultiSelect component uses the `Listbox` role, and each list item has an `option` role. The following
`ARIA attributes` denotes the MultiSelect state:

| **Properties** | **Functionalities** |
| --- | --- |
| aria-haspopup | Indicates whether the MultiSelect input element has a popup list or not. |
| aria-expanded | Indicates whether the popup list has expanded or not. |
| aria-selected | Indicates the selected option. |
| aria-readonly | Indicates the readonly state of the MultiSelect element. |
| aria-disabled | Indicates whether the MultiSelect component is in disabled state or not. |
| aria-activedescendent | This attribute holds the ID of the active list item  to focus its descendant child element. |
| aria-owns | This attribute contains the ID of the popup list to indicate popup as a child element. |
