# Accessibility

## ARIA Attributes

The web accessibility makes web content and web applications more accessible for people with disabilities. It especially helps in dynamic content change and development of advanced user interface controls with AJAX, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies. ListBox provides built-in compliance with WAI-ARIA specifications. WAI-ARIA support is achieved through the attributes like `aria-multiselectable` and `aria-selected` applied for ListBox element and selected elements in the ListBox. It helps the people with disabilities by providing information about the widget for assistive technology in the screen readers. ListBox component contains the `listbox` role and `option` role.

| Properties | Functionality |
| ------------ | ----------------------- |
| listbox | This role will be specified for root element. |
| aria-multiselectable | Applied to the element with the ListBox role, tells assistive technologies that the list supports multiple selection. The default value is true. |
| option | Identifies each selectable element containing the name of an option. |
| aria-selected | Applied to elements with role option that are visually styled as selected to inform assistive technologies that the options are selected. |
