# Accessibility

The ComboBox component has been designed, keeping in mind the `WAI-ARIA` specifications, and applies
the WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties along with `keyboard support`. This component is characterized
by complete keyboard interaction support and ARIA accessibility support that makes it easy for people who
use assistive technologies (AT) or those who completely rely on keyboard navigation.

## ARIA attributes

The ComboBox component uses the `combobox` role, and each list item has an `option` role. The following
`ARIA attributes` denotes the ComboBox state:

| **Properties**        | **Functionalities**                                                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| aria-haspopup         | Indicates whether the ComboBox input element has a popup list or not.                                                  |
| aria-expanded         | Indicates whether the popup list has expanded or not.                                                                  |
| aria-selected         | Indicates the selected option.                                                                                         |
| aria-readonly         | Indicates the readonly state of the ComboBox element.                                                                  |
| aria-disabled         | Indicates whether the ComboBox component is in a disabled state or not.                                                |
| aria-activedescendent | This attribute holds the ID of the active list item to focus its descendant child element.                             |
| aria-owns             | This attribute contains the ID of the popup list to indicate popup as a child element.                                 |
| aria-autocomplete     | This attribute contains the ‘both’ to a list of options shows and the currently selected suggestion also shows inline. |

## Keyboard interaction

You can use the following key shortcuts to access the ComboBox without interruptions:

| **Keyboard shortcuts**  | **Actions**                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| <kbd>Enter</kbd>        | Selects the focused item and popup list closes when it is in open state.                                                                                |

> In the following sample, disable the ComboBox component using <kbd>t</kbd> keys.

```csharp
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.DropDowns

<SfComboBox TValue="string" TItem="Countries" @ref="ComboObj" Enabled="@enable" Placeholder="Select a country" @onkeypress="@(e => KeyPressed(e))" DataSource="@LocalData">
    <ComboBoxFieldSettings Value="Code" Text="Name"></ComboBoxFieldSettings>
</SfComboBox>

@code {

    public SfComboBox<string, Countries> ComboObj;

    public bool enable { get; set; } = true;
    public class Countries
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public string Code { get; set; }
    }

    List<Countries> LocalData = new List<Countries> {
        new Countries() { Name = "Australia", Code = "AU" },
        new Countries() { Name = "Bermuda", Code = "BM" },
        new Countries() { Name = "Canada", Code = "CA" },
        new Countries() { Name = "Cameroon", Code = "CM" },
        new Countries() { Name = "Denmark", Code = "DK" },
        new Countries() { Name = "France", Code = "FR" },
        new Countries() { Name = "Finland", Code = "FI" },
        new Countries() { Name = "Germany", Code = "DE" },
        new Countries() { Name = "Greenland", Code = "GL" },
        new Countries() { Name = "Hong Kong", Code = "HK" },
    };

    public void KeyPressed(KeyboardEventArgs args)
    {
        if (args.Key == "t")
        {
            enable = false;
        }
    }
}
```

The output will be as follows.
