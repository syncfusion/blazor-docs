## Importing Syncfusion Blazor component in the application

* Install `Syncfusion.Blazor.Calendars` NuGet package to the application by using the `NuGet Package Manager`.

> Please ensure to check the `Include prerelease` option for our Beta release.

* You can add the client-side resources through CDN or from NuGet package in the  **HEAD** element of the **~/Pages/_Host.cshtml** page.

 ```html
    <head>
            <link href="_content/Syncfusion.Blazor.Themes/bootstrap4.css" rel="stylesheet" />
            @*<link href="https://cdn.syncfusion.com/blazor/{{version}}/styles/{{theme}}.css" rel="stylesheet" />*@
    </head>
```

> For Internet Explorer 11 kindly refer the polyfills. Refer the [documentation](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/blazor/documentation/common/how-to/render-blazor-server-app-in-ie/) for more information.

 ```html
    <head>
        <link href="_content/Syncfusion.Blazor.Themes/bootstrap4.css" rel="stylesheet" />
        <script src="https://github.com/Daddoon/Blazor.Polyfill/releases/download/3.0.1/blazor.polyfill.min.js"></script>
    </head>
```

## Adding component package to the application

Open `~/_Imports.razor` file and import the `Syncfusion.Blazor.Calendars` package.

```csharp
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Calendars
```

## Add SyncfusionBlazor service in Startup.cs

Open the **Startup.cs** file and add services required by Syncfusion components using  **services.AddSyncfusionBlazor()** method. Add this method in the **ConfigureServices** function as follows.

```csharp
using Syncfusion.Blazor;

namespace BlazorApplication
{
    public class Startup
    {
        ....
        ....
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            ....
            ....
            services.AddSyncfusionBlazor();
        }
    }
}
```

> To enable custom client side resource loading from CRG or CDN. You need to disable resource loading by `AddSyncfusionBlazor(true)` and load the scripts in the **HEAD** element of the **~/Pages/_Host.cshtml** page.

 ```html
    <head>
            <script src="https://cdn.syncfusion.com/blazor/{:version:}/syncfusion-blazor.min.js"></script>
    </head>
```

## Adding TimePicker component to the application

To initialize the TimePicker component add the below code to your `Index.razor` view page which is present under `~/Pages` folder.

The following code shows a basic TimePicker component.

```csharp
<SfTimePicker TValue="DateTime?" PlaceHolder="Select a time"></SfTimePicker>
```

## Run the application

After successful compilation of your application, press `F5` to run the application.

The output will be as follows.

![TimePicker](./images/default.png)

## Setting the time format

Time format is a way of representing the time value in different string format in textbox and popup list. By default, the TimePickerâ€™s Format is based on the culture.
But you can customize the Format of the TimePicker using the [Format](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Calendars.SfTimePicker-1.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_Calendars_SfTimePicker_1_Format) property.

The below code demonstrates how to render TimePicker component in 24 hours Format with 60 minutes interval. The time interval is set to 60 minutes by using the [Step](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Calendars.SfTimePicker-1.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_Calendars_SfTimePicker_1_Step) property.

```csharp
<SfTimePicker TValue="DateTime?" Value="@TimeValue" Step=60 Format="HH:mm"></SfTimePicker>

@code {
    public DateTime TimeValue { get; set; } = DateTime.Now;
}
```

The output will be as follows.
