* Drag Events - UIDragEventArgs
* Keyboard Events - UIKeyboardEventArgs
* Input Events - UIChangeEventArgs/UIEventArgs
* Touch Events – UITouchEventArgs

## How to bind focus event to Switch

The ‘onfocus’ attribute is used to bind the focus event for Switch. Here, we have explained about the sample code snippets.

`Default.razor`

```csharp
@using Syncfusion.EJ2.RazorComponents.Buttons

<label>onfocus</label><EjsSwitch Onfocus="@onfocus"></EjsSwitch>

@code {

    private void onfocus(UIFocusEventArgs args)
    {
       //onfocus Event triggered
    }
}

```
